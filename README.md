# PortfolioManagement

This is a work in progress. The Project_MM notebook has some cool analysis on stock picking and portfolio optimization using the Markovitz theory.

Script will be updated to add more functionality.

The final aim is to create a bot which clusters stocks, identifies optimum portfolio weights for a given investment seed and rebalances the portfolio when required (autonomously).
